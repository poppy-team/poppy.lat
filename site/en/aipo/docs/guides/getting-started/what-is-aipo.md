# What is Aipo?

**Aipo** is a modern general-purpose programming language featuring dynamic and strong typing, paired with native signature contracts and structural invariants.

Engineered with a philosophy of **clarity, robustness, and predictability**, Aipo was built from the ground up in Rust using Clean Architecture boundaries.

---

## Core Pillars

### 1. Dynamic and Strong Typing

In Aipo, values have concrete types and the runtime never performs arbitrary or hidden conversions between incompatible types:

```aipo
let x = "42"
let y = 10

// Runtime type fault:
// Operator '+' does not concatenate String and Int implicitly
let z = x + y // Explicit failure!
```

Converting or concatenating values requires clear programmer intent.

### 2. Structural Invariants & Contracts

While traditional languages require scattering manual assertions across every method, Aipo introduces the `invariant()` hook inside the struct's `impl` block:

```aipo
struct Temperature {
    var celsius = 0.0
}

impl Temperature {
    invariant {
        self.celsius >= -273.15 # Cannot be below absolute zero
    }
}
```

Any mutation that violates an invariant is intercepted at the boundary. Inside `attempt { ... } failed err { ... }` transaction blocks, modifications undergo atomic rollback to their previous state.

### 3. Deterministic Concurrency

Aipo's concurrency model is founded on **cooperative fibers and virtual time**. Async calls utilize `async fn` and high-level combinators (`task.spawn`, `task.sleep`, `task.all`, `task.race`), orchestrated by a deterministic scheduler that enables 100% reproducible tests.

### 4. Dual Target: Native VM and JavaScript

The Aipo compiler targets two first-class runtimes:
1. **Rust Bytecode VM**: Fast execution, deterministic `.aibc` binary serialization, and instruction disassembly with mapped line/column metadata.
2. **JavaScript Backend (`aipo-js`)**: Direct transpilation to modern ES2022 with a modular runtime shim, guaranteeing bit-for-bit differential parity.
